    "1. Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)\n",
    "Qualitative data represent characteristics or qualities that cannot be measured in numerical terms. Instead, they describe attributes or labels and are often used to group data into categories. Qualitative data can be further divided into two subtypes: nominal and ordinal.\n",

    "Gender (Male, Female, Non-binary)\n",
    "Eye color (Blue, Brown, Green)\n",

It involves selecting a subset of individuals or data points from a larger population in such a way that each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.
